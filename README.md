# eventsExplorer

A graphical user interface for defining discrete events in (hydrological) time series, split out from https://github.com/josephguillaume/hydromad

This package depends on [playwith](https://github.com/floybix/playwith), which in turn depends on `gWidgets` and `gWidgetsRGtk2`, neither of which are maintained on CRAN.

This package is therefore not currently maintained.
